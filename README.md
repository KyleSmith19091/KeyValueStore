    <h1>Transactional Key Value Store Implmentation</h1>
</div>

<p>
This is an <strong>in progress implmentation</strong> of a transactional Key-Value store implementation from scratch. Currently we only use few standard library functions such as strings, io and unordered maps as the stores. This is purely educational, where I wanted to implement as much of the functionality from scratch, such as creating my own Stack and in the future a hashmap implementation.
</p>

---
## Installation ‚ö°Ô∏è

* Building from sratch

This requires a g++ compiler, that is also able to compile c++ 11
```bash
make
```
<p>
This creates the executable in the build directory
</p>

You'll then be presented with the following prompt
```bash
> 
```

This 'mini-shell' environment will serve as your interface into the key-value store

## CRUD Operations ‚≠êÔ∏è
<strong>** Note, keys are case sensitive, but the operations are not.</strong>

<h4 align="center">READ</h4>

```bash
> GET KEY
```
<h4 align="center">WRITE</h4>

```bash
> SET KEY VALUE
```

<strong>** In this case the value can be anything, the interpreter will assume that all input after the given KEY is the value. This does include space seperated data.</strong>

<strong>For Ex.</strong>

```bash
> SET full-name John Smith II
```

<h4 align="center">UPDATE</h4>

```bash
> PUT KEY VALUE
```

<strong>** SET can also be used as a PUT, it will overwrite the key's value</strong>

<h4 align="center">DELETE</h4>

```bash
> DELETE KEY
```

## Transactional Operations üö¶ 
Since this is a transactional key-value store implementation, we need the ability to create, end, rollback and commit transactions. Transactions are handled using a Stack, where the 
top of the stack represents the <i>active</i> transaction.

<h4 align="center">BEGIN: Starts a new transaction</h4>

```bash
> BEGIN
```

<h4 align="center">END: Ends the current active transaction</h4>

```bash
> END
```
<h4 align="center">ROLLBACK: Discards the changes made by current transaction</h4>

```bash
> ROLLBACK
```

<h4 align="center">COMMIT: Commits the changes made by active transaction to global store</h4>

```bash
> ROLLBACK
```

## Other Operations üß™

<h4 align="center">CLEAR</h4>
To clear the 'shell'

```bash	
> CLEAR
```

<h4 align="center">EXIT</h4>
To gracefully exit the shell, CTRL+C or your equivalent will also work

```bash
> EXIT
```

<h4 align="center">PRINT</h4>
To Print the current active transaction's store

```bash
> PRINT
```

## Additional Notes üéâ
You can customise the prompt token, by changing the constructor value in the Main.cpp file

```c++
int main() {
	// Interface into key-value store
	Shell s("‚ùØ");
	s.init();

	return 0;
}
```
