    <h1>Transactional Key Value Store Implmentation</h1>
</div>

<p>
This is an <strong>in progress implmentation</strong> of a transactional Key-Value store implementation from scratch. Currently we only use few standard library functions such as strings, io and unordered maps as the stores. This is purely educational, where I wanted to implement as much of the functionality from scratch, such as creating my own Stack and in the future a hashmap implementation.
